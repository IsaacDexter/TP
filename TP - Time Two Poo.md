- 3 rooms - levels to find toilet with golden tp to clog him with so you can escape
	- each room has its own ETA
		- at 0, pass out, poop everywhere sfx, back to lobby

	- after each toilet gives their golden tp, they flush player back to hub
	- coming out of each room lights the toilet braziers infront of that door
